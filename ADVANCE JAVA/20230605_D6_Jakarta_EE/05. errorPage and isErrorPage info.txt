

page directive's two more attributes are 

errorPage and isErrorPage

errorPage is used to inform web container about error page you are going to use for this jsp.

isErrorPage is used to make jsp as error page.
	isErrorPage is "false" by default. That is JSP page is not an error page by default.
	in order to make JSP as an error page , inside it you have to say  isErrorPage="true"
	"exception" implicit object can be accessed inside error jsp only.
