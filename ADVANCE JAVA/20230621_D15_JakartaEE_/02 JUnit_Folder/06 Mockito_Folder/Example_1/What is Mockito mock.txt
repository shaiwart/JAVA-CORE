

  authenticatorMock = Mockito.mock(AuthenticatorInterface.class);

mock() method of "Mockito" will
	a) generate Mock of AuthenticatorInterfaceImpl
	b) instantiate this mock 

that means we can say that "authenticatorMock" reference refers to the mock object ( mock implementation of AuthenticatorInterface)
