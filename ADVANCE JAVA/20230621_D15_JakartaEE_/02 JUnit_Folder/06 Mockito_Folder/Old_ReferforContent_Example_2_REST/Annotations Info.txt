@Mock
    private ProductDAO dao;


@Mock will create a mock implementation for the ProductDao


@InjectMocks
    private ProductManagerImpl productManager;


@InjectMocks will inject the mocks marked with @Mock to this instance when it is created.

So when or where are these instances created? Well, it is done in this line, which resides in the setUp method:

MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);

So these instances would be created at the start of every test method of this test class.
