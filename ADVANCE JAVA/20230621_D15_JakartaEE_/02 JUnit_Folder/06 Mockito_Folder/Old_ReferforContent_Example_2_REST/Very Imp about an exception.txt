while running test case class if you get following exception:


java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not initialize plugin: interface org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker (alternate: null)


The solution is 
	close the project
	go to "repository"
	delete "net" folder
	reopen the project
		it will take some time to again download the required dependencies
	now run your test class and make sure it works.
