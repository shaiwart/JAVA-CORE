@Mock is used to declare/mock the references of the dependent beans, 

while @InjectMocks is used to mock the bean for which test is being created. 

@InjectMocks annotation can be used to inject mock fields into a test object automatically.

e.g.

@Service
public class ProductManagerImpl implements ProductManager
{
	@Autowired
	ProductDAO dao;
}


	@Mock
  	private ProductDAO dao;

	@InjectMocks
	private ProductManagerImpl productManager;

so here "@InjectMocks" means that productManager shouldn't be mocked. It requires "Product dao" as dependency. So "dao" shouldn't be given actual implementation, it should be given mock implementation inside "ProductManager" class. ie. InjectMocks
