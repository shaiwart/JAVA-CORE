in this example instead of "AppConfig.java" we have "mydispatcher-servlet.xml" inside "src\main\resources" folder.

we have used an annotation inside "EmpDAOTest.java" 
	@ContextConfiguration(locations = {
        "classpath:mydispatcher-servlet.xml"})


for "classpath:mydispatcher-servlet.xml" to work it is very imp. that "mydispatcher-servlet.xml" file has to be placed inside "src\main\resources" folder.
