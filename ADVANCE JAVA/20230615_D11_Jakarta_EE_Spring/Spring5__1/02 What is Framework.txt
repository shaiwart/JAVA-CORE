What is Framework?

Framework consist of classes and interfaces.
These classes and interfaces can work together in order to solve a particular problem.
Framework components are reusable.

Frameworks are large bodies of pre-written code to which you add your own code in order to solve a problem. Java frameworks are software libraries created to make building Java applications easier and faster.
