Resource leak: 'context' is never closed - warning

ApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("student.xml");

you need to invoke "close" on context but the method is not available with "ApplicationContext", hence you need to write:


ApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("student.xml");
	// other statements


context.close();
