PreparedStatement has 2 advantages:
a) u can use placeholder so that values can be passed dynamically
b) PreparedStatement contains precompiled sql statements which enable faster execution.


suppose we want to issue same query again and again:

Statement st=con.createStatement();
st.executeQuery("select * from dept");
		a) query goes to database
		b) it gets parsed,compiled
		c) execution plan is made
		d) query gets executed.

st.executeQuery("select * from dept");
		a) query goes to database
		b) it gets parsed,compiled
		c) execution plan is made
		d) query gets executed.

st.executeQuery("select * from dept");
		a) query goes to database
		b) it gets parsed,compiled
		c) execution plan is made
		d) query gets executed.


if we use PrepareStatement,

PreparedStatement pst=con.prepareStatement("select * from dept");
		a) query goes to database
		b) it gets parsed,compiled
		c) execution plan is made
pst.executeQuery();
	query gets executed
pst.executeQuery();
	query gets executed
pst.executeQuery();
	query gets executed
