	int no=rs.getInt("deptno");
	String name=rs.getString("dname");

		above statements prove that programmer knows 3 things
		a) how many columns are there
		b) what are their names
		c) what are their types.

what if programmer does not know any of these? will he be able to display records?
	yes, with the help of "ResultSetMetaData" interface which gives complete information about ResultSet such as no.of columns , their names , types etc.
