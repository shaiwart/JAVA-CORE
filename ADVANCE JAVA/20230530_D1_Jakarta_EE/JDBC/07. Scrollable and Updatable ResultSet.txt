
By default ResultSet is readonly and forward only. It means while traversing through the ResultSet we cannot modify records and we have only one method for traversing i.e. "next".

But we can make ResultSet updatable ( while traversing through the ResultSet we can modify records) and scrollable ( not only "next" we can invoke "previous" or "absolute" method also )
