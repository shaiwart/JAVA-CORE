Install maven
Set path
D:\apache-maven-3.9.2\bin
Set
maven_home		D:\apache-maven-3.9.2
m2_home		D:\apache-maven-3.9.2

now open a new command prompt and give

mvn   command

it will give some message and error also. Don't worry go to "c:\users\<username>" and make sure 
.m2 folder has been created.
inside this ".m2" folder you will get a folder "repository".
this is your "local repository" in which all the required jar files will be kept.
