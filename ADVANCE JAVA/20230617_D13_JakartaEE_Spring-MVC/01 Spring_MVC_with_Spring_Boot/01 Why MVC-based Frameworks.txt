core MVC solves most of the problems u have faced in Model 1 architecture. i.e. high maintenance and no reusability. But when volume of application is large, i.e. u have so many forms,javabeans and view components (jsps), your controller will become overburdened.
moreover if in future application workflow is changed,u will face the problem of maintenance in controller.

Solution:
	MVC-based Frameworks
		struts,springMVC,JSF

How these frameworks will solve your problem?

	They will provide u a Controller and that Controller will work according to Application Workflow u have mentioned inside some xml configuration file or through annotation.
