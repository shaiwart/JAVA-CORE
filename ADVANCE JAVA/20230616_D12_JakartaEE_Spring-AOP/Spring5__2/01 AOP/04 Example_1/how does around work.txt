Object invoke(MethodInvocation mi)

here "mi" is a reference of MethodInvocation and it represents "target method" i.e. in our example "multiply"


suppose client invokes multiply:

multiply(0,0);
	inside invoke method we have

	if(num1==0 && num2==0)
        {
            throw new Exception("Cannot Multiply 0 with 0");
        }

so here control will not go inside "multiply()" method and exception will be thrown to the user application.


multiply(3,4);

	control goes inside invoke method. 
	since values are not 0 ,0

	Object result=mi.proceed();
		because of "proceed" control will go to multiply method and result will be returned back to "invoke" method.
	return result;
		here invoke method returns result to user.
