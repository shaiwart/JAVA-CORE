

1) we invoke "queryForObject()" of JdbcTemplate
2) it accepts two arguments:
	a) query
	b) RowMapper implementation which has a method "mapRow()"
3) mapRow() has an argument "ResultSet"


Who invokes mapRow()? or how does queryForObject work?

queryForObject fires the query with the database.
it gets ResultSet.
it invokes ResultSet's next() method.
after ensuring that ResultSet is not empty, queryForObject invokes "mapRow()" by passing ResultSet.

Then mapRow traverses that ResultSet and retrieves records.
