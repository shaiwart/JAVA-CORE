right click on "java"

		inside "mypack" create "MyBean.java"


right click on the project
	run as
		run on server

now once your projects run successfully , let's go and create a war file which can be deployed on any server.


for that,

close the Eclipse tomcat server

find out your workspace folder
	C:\Users\Sriram\eclipse-workspace  - in my case

go to 
	"C:\Users\Sriram\eclipse-workspace\myjar\target" folder (in my case)
you won't find any "war" file.

now come back in Eclipse

right click on the project name i.e. "myjar"

	run as
		maven install

it will take some time but make sure you get "BUILD SUCCESS" message.

now close your project.

go to
	"C:\Users\Sriram\eclipse-workspace\myjar\target" folder (in my case)

you will find "myjar.war" file.

now open command prompt and give following command
	startup

make sure tomcat server starts properly

now go to "D:\apache-tomcat-10.1.8\webapps"
	count how many folders are there
		[ in my case 5 folders are there ]
now copy "myjar.war" file from "C:\Users\Sriram\eclipse-workspace\myjar\target"  to "webapps"
	wait for some seconds
you will find one more folder by the name "myjar" automatically gets created inside "webapps" folder. This is called as "deploying your web application (myjar.war) on the server".

now go to browser and type
	http://localhost:8080/myjar

make sure you get the output.


also check inside
	C:\Users\Sriram\.m2\repository

you'll find a folder "com"
inside "com"
you will get "myjar" folder and inside it you will find
	myjar.war file.
