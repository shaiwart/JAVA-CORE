one of the applications in which Proxy design pattern used is "RMI".

Remote Method Invocation

	method existing on server invoked by client


On Server side:

1) developer will create remote interface which will be shared with client.

public interface MyInterface extends Remote   // Remote interface
{
	String message();   // business method
}

2) developer will create implementation

public class MyInterfaceImpl implements MyInterface   // server object
{
	public String message()   
	{
		return "hello";  // business logic
	}
}

3) developer will create proxy of above implementation to be shared with client.

4) developer will bind above implementation of proxy inside "RMIRegistry"


public class MyInterfaceImpl_Stub implements MyInterface   // proxy object
{
	public String message()   
	{
		// networking logic which can go over the network and invoke the actual method
	}
}

5) developer will share "MyInterface.class" and "MyInterfaceImpl_Stub" with client.



On client side:

1) lookup remote object inside RmiRegistry

	MyInterface ref=lookup......

	above statement will give client instance of "MyInterfaceImpl_Stub".
since, MyInterfaceImpl_Stub implements "MyInterface", we store it inside "MyInterface" reference.

2) invoke business method (remote method)
	ref.disp();
here when client side code tries to invoke "disp()" method, it will invoke "MyInterfaceImpl_Stub" disp() method which can go over the network and invoke actual method.
when the method on server returns a value it does not come directly to client. It is passed to the stub and stub gives it to the client.
