public void doFilter(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res,FilterChain chain)
	{
		try
		{
		// logic to be performed
			chain.doFilter(req,res);
		}

when filter invokes "chain.doFilter(req,res)" it indicates web container that 
	I have done my job
	next component ( another filter/servlet/jsp) should be invoked.

once filter indicates web container about that, container invokes next component ( another filter/servlet/jsp) inside Filter chain.
