association table will be:

+---------------+--------------+


inside joined table

first column (employees_eid) is called as "joined column"
and
second column (projects_pid) is called as "inverse column"



we can change the name of joined table if we want. For that we need to make following changes in "Employee.java" :

@Entity
public class Employee 
{
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
	private int eid;
	private String ename;
	
	
	@ManyToMany 
	@JoinTable(name="Em_Pr") // name of the association table
	private List<Project> projects;
		// setters and getters

}

association table will be:

mysql> select * from em_pr;
